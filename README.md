# react-native-tus-client
React Native client for the **tus** resumable upload protocol [tus.io](https://tus.io) inspired to [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client).


It provides a native tus compliant implementation through the official [TUSKit](https://github.com/tus/TUSKit) and [tus-android-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-android-client) libraries.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-tus-client --save`

or

`$ yarn add react-native-tus-client`

### Mostly automatic installation

```
# RN >= 0.60
cd ios && pod install

# RN < 0.60
react-native link react-native-tus-client
```

### Manual installation


#### iOS

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-tus-client` and add `RNTusClient.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNTusClient.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`
  - Add `import com.vinzscam.RNTusClientPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new RNTusClientPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```
  	include ':react-native-tus-client'
  	project(':react-native-tus-client').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-tus-client/android')
  	```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```
      compile project(':react-native-tus-client')
  	```

## Usage
All you need to know to upload a file to a [tus](https://tus.io/) server is the **local absolute path where the file is stored**.
If you know it, you can just invoke the library as described in the snippet at the end of this section.
If you don't know where your file is stored, some other library like [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-image-picker) might help you.


### Upload a file by its absolute path

```javascript
import { Upload } from 'react-native-tus-client';

const absoluteFilePath = // absolute path to your file;
const upload = new Upload(absoluteFilePath, {
  endpoint: 'https://master.tus.io/files/', // use your tus server endpoint instead
  onError: error => console.log('error', error),
  onSuccess: () => {
    console.log('Upload completed! File url:', upload.url);
  },
  onProgress: (uploaded, total) => console.log(
    `Progress: ${(uploaded/total*100)|0}%`)
});
upload.start();

```

### Upload an image using [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-image-picker)

```javascript
import ImagePicker from 'react-native-image-picker';
import { Upload } from 'react-native-tus-client';

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  ImagePicker.showImagePicker({ }, ({ uri, error, path }) => {
    return uri ? resolve(path || uri) : reject(error || null);
  });
})
.then(file => {
  const upload = new Upload(file, {
    endpoint: 'https://master.tus.io/files/', // use your tus server endpoint instead
    onError: error => console.log('error', error),
    onSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Upload completed. File url:', upload.url);
    },
    onProgress: (uploaded, total) => console.log(
      `Progress: ${(uploaded/total*100)|0}%`)
  });
  upload.start();
})
.catch(e => console.log('error', e));

```
